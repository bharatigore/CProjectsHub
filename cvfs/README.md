<h1>Project Title:- CVFS</h1><h3>Customised Virtual File System</h3>
<h2>Project Description:-</h2>
<ul>
  o	This project is virtual representation of file system.
  <br>
o	File System is considered as way of storing information about file and data from the file into the secondary storage device.<br>
o	Every operating system has its own type of file system (ANTIFS,FAT32,FAT16,USF).<br>
o	In this project we implement the layout of complete file system,PROM,hard disk,RAM.<br>
o	In this project we implement almost every related system call used in file manipulation activity along with some important commands.<br>
o	This is research based project. We develop this project to understand internals of an operating systemand to explore data structure implementation of C programming. <br>
